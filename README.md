Currently working on DNA sequencer/Genetic sequencing software This software will allows researchers to identify changes in genes, associations with diseases and phenotypes, and identify potential drug targets also help in data analysis. Help in understand the mutation of bacteria ,viruses etc.

A DNA sequencer is a scientific instrument used to automate the DNA sequencing process. Given a sample of DNA, a DNA sequencer is used to determine the order of the four bases: G (guanine), C (cytosine), A (adenine) and T (thymine). This is then reported as a text string, called a read.
